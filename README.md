# Stiebel Eltron heat pump integration as Home Assistant sensors
## What it does
Stiebel Eltron HTTP is a Home Assistant integration that connects and scrapes your local Stiebel Eltron ISG webserver to retrieve data from your heat pump system, as HA sensors. See below the provided sensors.

It is not meant to be a climate entity and thus cannot set the temperatures, change the modes, etc. See the official HA integration for that (but know that you'll need to find a way to activate Modbus on your ISG, which might or might not be possible).

This integration is designed to work out-of-the-box and auto-discover your Stiebel Eltron ISG device.

It has also been reported to work with some Tecalor-branded ISG devices, like WPF13.

## Prerequisites
- A [Stiebel Eltron heat pump](https://www.stiebel-eltron.com/en/home/products-solutions/renewables/heat_pump.html)
- A [Stiebel Eltron Internet Service Gateway (ISG)](https://www.stiebel-eltron.com/en/home/products-solutions/renewables/controller_energymanagement/isg-web/isg-web.html), connected to your heat pump and your network


## Installation

## Provided sensors

- Room temperature
- Room relative humidity
- Outside temperature
- Flow temperature
- Target flow temperature
- Heating produced (daily reset, correctly handled by HA)
- Total heating produced (ever)
- Energy consumption (daily reset, correctly handled by HA)
- Total energy consumption (ever)
- Compressor starts
- Compressor status (on/off)
- Auxiliary heater status (on/off)
- Booster heater status (on/off)
